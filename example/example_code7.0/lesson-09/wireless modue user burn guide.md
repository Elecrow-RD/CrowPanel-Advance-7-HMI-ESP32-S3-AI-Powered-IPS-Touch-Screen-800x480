### 3.Burning

RX is connected to TX of the serial module;

TX connection to the RX of the serial module;

3V3 connection to the 3V3 of the serial module;

GND connection to the GND of the serial module.

Connect the serial module to the computer and find the corresponding serial device number (e.g. COM35) in the Task Manager.
